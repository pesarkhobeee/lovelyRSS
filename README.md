<summary><strong>🎨 Customization</strong></summary>

Once you have your reader up and running, you can personalize it to make it your own.

### Personalize Your Reader

Create a `config.json` file (you can copy `config.json.template`) to change your site's title, description, and how often it updates.

### Change the Look and Feel

Create a `static/custom.css` file to add your own styles and completely change the appearance of your reader.

### Format Your Feeds File

If your `feeds.opml` file gets messy, you can automatically format it by running the "Format OPML File" workflow in the Actions tab of your repository.

<summary><strong>🤝 The Spirit of Sharing</strong></summary>

`lovelyRSS` is more than just a tool; it's an invitation to a more open and decentralized way of sharing information. By sharing your reading list, you are helping to build a more connected and curious web.

### How to Follow a Friend

Instead of subscribing to every feed your friend follows, you can subscribe to their generated `latest_rss.xml` feed. This single feed contains the latest posts from all of their subscriptions, making it easy to see what they're reading without overwhelming your own reader.

We encourage you to share your reader with your friends and on your social media. Let's build a more open web together!

### Generated Files for Sharing

Your `lovelyRSS` instance produces several files that make it easy to share what you're reading:

-   **`index.html`**: The main, shareable webpage that displays your feeds and the latest posts.
-   **`latest_rss.xml`**: A merged RSS feed of the latest posts from all your subscriptions. This is perfect for friends who want to follow your reading list in their own RSS reader.
-   **`latest_feeds.xml`**: An XML file listing all the feeds you subscribe to, sorted by the most recently updated.

These files are updated automatically and can be found at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

<summary><strong>🔄 Updating Your Fork</strong></summary>

One of the goals of `lovelyRSS` is to make it easy to keep your personal reader up-to-date with the latest features. We have designed the workflow to be completely conflict-free, so you can pull in the latest changes without any risk of losing your personal configurations.

Since your `feeds.opml` and `config.json` files are not tracked by git, you can safely fetch the latest changes from the main repository without creating any merge conflicts. Your reader will simply be updated with the newest features, and your feeds will be regenerated on the next scheduled run.

To update your fork, simply run the following commands in your local repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

This will keep your reader current while preserving your unique feed list and settings.
